# Image Scaler for Windows Universal apps
This is a Visual Studio extension that allows for easy logo image creation. It takes large source images and creates resized copies that are used for app logos and splash screens.

For example, it'll take "logo-src.png" and generate:
* logo.scale-100.png
* logo.scale-200.png
* logo.scale-400.png

Just right-click on logo-src.png in your solution explorer with your project open.
