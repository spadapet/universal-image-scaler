# Image Scaler for Windows Universal apps
This is a Visual Studio extension that allows for easy logo image creation. It takes large source images and creates resized copies that are used for app logos and splash screens.

# How to use

Right click any .png image and choose the new "Scale image..." context menu item.

If the file already has a scale (like scale-400.png) in its filename, then you will be given the option to generate the smaller scales.

If the file doesn't have a scale-xxx in its name, then you will be given the option to generate either square or wide images for Windows Universal App manifests. Depends on if your image is a square or not. It's best to start with really large images so that a lot of smaller scales can be generated.
